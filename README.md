# Turtle Race Game

## Description
The Turtle Race Game is a simple racing game implemented using Python's `turtle` and `tkinter` modules. Players can choose between one-player and two-player modes, where turtles move forward randomly or by user input to reach the finish line first.

## Features
- Single-player mode (compete against the computer)
- Two-player mode (compete against another player)
- Randomized movement for fairness
- Visual countdown before the race starts
- Finish line detection and winner announcement
- Option to restart the race

## Technologies Used
- Python
- `turtle` module for graphics
- `tkinter` module for player selection
- `time` module for delays
- `random` module for randomized movements

## How to Play
1. Run the script.
2. A selection window will appear:
   - Choose **1 Player** to compete against the computer.
   - Choose **2 Players** to play with a friend.
3. The race will start after a countdown.
4. **Controls:**
   - **Single-player mode:** Press `O` to move your turtle.
   - **Two-player mode:**
     - Player 1: Press `W` to move.
     - Player 2: Press `O` to move.
5. The first turtle to cross the finish line wins.
6. After the race, you can choose to restart or exit.
